### CONTACT LIST APP

* Build a simple contact list application in SpringBoot with a REST API. 
* Users can create, edit, delete and list their contacts. Each contact has a name, phone number and email address stored 
in a database. Build a very simple frontend, which can call the API to display and edit the data.
* Bonus: provide a docker file with installation and deployment instructions.
